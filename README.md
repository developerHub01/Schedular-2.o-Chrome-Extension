  - After your input data you have to choose the types of schedule. 

  - 'One time schedule' mean's that it will notify only one time and then it's history will be clear. It is useful for any meeting that you need to set an reminder.
  
  - 'Regular time schedule' mean's that will notify regular, every day at a perticular time it will send a notification to remind you.

  - and the last one and my favourite one is 'Frequently time schedule' mean's here you have featrue to choose that day and time of the weak to schedule, and every scheduled time and day of weak will notify you. For example if your choose that in Friday you choose 3:30PM means in every Friday of each weak at 3:30PM you will get a notificaiton, I think it will healpfull for that students.
